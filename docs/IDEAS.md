## serialplot fork ideas:
 - [ ] settings creator tool (gui) that lets you change
 - [ ] plot tabe at bottom:  split into two sets of columns so you can see more at one time. 
 - [ ] window cursors:  overlay ac noise, dc noise, slope (linear regression best effort, 1st order), min, max, avg...
  - [ ] ^ later, try 2nd and 3rd order, other types of fit...)
 - [ ] two or more plot groups.  each has a channel selector. 
 - [ ] change to BIN pack - allow more suited type for us. 
 - [ ] build on MAC. 
 - [ ] side panel to show ALL data coming in 
 - [ ] side panel to pick up SWO comms? 
 - [ ] somewhere to keep ideas ?  MD FILE?  docs folders
 - [ ] channel options - add INTERPOLATION (to gain etc)
 - [ ] channel options - add units? 
 - [ ] x axis - be clearer what scale / units are
 - [ ] x-y:  zoom in. 
 - [ ] have a "digitial channel" type (eg for valve pack) - seperate grid, put markers, view in HEX, have a BITFIELD (name + bit,  name appears on y axis)
 - [ ] command structure setup - plug in (wireshark esque)- make one specific for lg01 comms protocol (use the repo json!!)
